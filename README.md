### SzDT_ASV.xlsx
The table contains 13,566 verb argument structure vectors, which were determined based on the data from the Szeged Dependency Treebank.  

The first seven columns contain the unique characteristics of the verbs:
- **pvform** - verbal modifier form (0: no verbal modifier)
- **lemma** - the lemma of the verb, without the verbal modifier and the causative/potential suffix
- **pvv** - verbal modifier + lemma
- **mood** - the mood of the verb (cnd: conditional, imp: imperative, ind: indicative, inf: infinitive)
- **cau** - causative
- **pot** - potential
- **n** - the number of occurrences of the verb in the corpus

The remaining columns show the frequency of occurrence of each supplement type.
- **PV** - separated verbal modifier
- **CP_cnd** - conditional clause
- **CP_imp** - imperative clause
- **CP_ind** - indicative clause
- **HKM** - *that*-clause
- **inf** - infinitival clause
- **nom** - nominative
- **acc** - accusative
- **dat** - dative
- **BAN** - inessive
- **ON** - superessive
- **RA** - sublative
- **VAL** - instrumental/comitative
- **UL** - essive-modalis
- **BA** - illative
- **RÓL** - delative
- **HOZ** - allative
- **BÓL** - elative
- **TÓL** - ablative
- **NÁL** - adessive
- **VÁ** - translative
- **IG** - terminative
- **ÉRT** - causalis
- **KÉNT** - essive-formalis
- **KOR** - temporal
- **SZOR** - multiplicative
- **NKÉNT** - distributive
- **ADP** - adposition
- **ADV** - adverbial
- **FROM** - metacategory
- **IN** - metacategory
- **TO** - metacategory

### {el/ki}-diff.tsv
The `el-diff.tsv` and `ki-diff.tsv` files are .tsv files containing the argument structure-changing effects of the 'el' and 'ki' verbal modifiers. The file contains the differences in argument structure vectors between the versions of the 100 most common verbs with and without verbal modifiers. The interpretation of the columns is the same as described for [`SzDT_ASV.xlsx`](#szdt_asvxlsx).

### dbscan.ipynb
The Jupyter notebook performs DBSCAN clustering on the difference vectors provided in the el-diff.tsv and ki-diff.tsv files. The goal of the program is to filter out the outlier elements from the data, in this case, the non-compositional occurrences of the verbal modifier. The program first lists the outlier elements with different parameter settings, then using the manually selected parameters, it generates the list of outlier elements (`{el/ki}-diff-dbscan.tsv`) and the list of non-outlier elements (`{el/ki}-diff-idioms.tsv`). The structure of the output files is the same as that of the input files.

### kmeans.ipynb
The Jupyter notebook performs k-means clustering on the difference vectors based on the `{el/ki}-diff-dbscan.tsv` files generated by the `dbscan.ipynb` notebook. The program performs clustering ranging from 2 to 20 clusters. The output of the program is the `{el/ki}-diff-clusters.tsv` file, which, in addition to the input data, contains separate columns for cluster labels corresponding to different numbers of clusters.

### {el/ki}-diff-clusters.xlsx
The files contain two sheets each, with the first sheet containing the data from `{el/ki}-diff-clusters.tsv` and the second sheet containing the data from `{el/ki}-diff-idioms.tsv`. In the tables, the most characteristic argument structure-changing effect of the verbal modifier is highlighted with color coding for each verb (indicating which supplement type's frequency increases or decreases to a greater extent). The rows of the table are sortable, allowing verbs belonging to the same cluster to be placed next to each other.
